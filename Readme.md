Description
===========

This package provides an Python implementation of the ElPiGraph algorithm. A
self-contained description of the algorithm is available
[here](https://github.com/auranic/Elastic-principal-graphs/blob/master/ElPiGraph_Methods.pdf)

A native MATLAB implementation of the algorithm (coded by [Andrei
Zinovyev](https://github.com/auranic/) and [Evgeny
Mirkes](https://github.com/Mirkes)) is also
[available](https://github.com/auranic/Elastic-principal-graphs)

Requirements
