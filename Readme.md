Description
===========

This package provides an Python implementation of the ElPiGraph algorithm. A
self-contained description of the algorithm is available
[here](https://github.com/auranic/Elastic-principal-graphs/blob/master/ElPiGraph_Methods.pdf)
or on this [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07580)

A native MATLAB implementation of the algorithm (coded by [Andrei
Zinovyev](https://github.com/auranic/) and [Evgeny
Mirkes](https://github.com/Mirkes)) is also
[available](https://github.com/auranic/Elastic-principal-graphs)

Requirements
============

This code was tested with Python 3.6, the following packages are needed:

-	numpy
-	matplotlib
-   scipy
-   pip

Installation
============

To install that package, open a terminal on the root of the git folder and type:
